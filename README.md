# Indecision

A simple app to keep track of a todo list and randomly choose one task to do.

The purpose of this app was for me to learn React and other related front end technologies.
- React
- Javascript
- es6
- babel
- webpack
- yarn
- scss

Install all dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```

Build the application (using webpack)
```bash
yarn run build
```

Run the application locally (using webpack)
```bash
yarn run dev-server
```
